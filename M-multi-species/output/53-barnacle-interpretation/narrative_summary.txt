SPECIES-INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS
------------------------------

A key focus of this analysis is identifying components NOT primarily driven by 
species differences - these represent conserved expression patterns shared across 
all three coral species and likely reflect fundamental biological processes.

ANNOTATION STATISTICS
---------------------

Across all components analyzed:
  • Total genes: 3525
  • Annotated: 1334 (37.8%)
  • Unannotated: 2191 (62.2%)
  • Mean % unannotated per component: 62.2%
  • Components with >50% unannotated: 33

This indicates that a significant portion of the coral transcriptome remains 
functionally uncharacterized, highlighting the need for continued annotation 
efforts in non-model marine organisms.

Species-Independent Components Annotation:
  • Mean % unannotated: 62.8%
  • Range: 43.6% - 76.0%

CONCLUSIONS
-----------
The tensor decomposition reveals that:

1. Gene expression patterns are largely conserved across the three coral species,
   suggesting shared stress response mechanisms and fundamental physiological 
   processes.

2. Temporal dynamics show distinct phases, with some components showing early 
   activation followed by decline, while others show progressive increases or 
   stable expression throughout the experiment.

3. Species-specific expression signatures exist alongside conserved patterns, 
   potentially reflecting evolutionary divergence in stress response strategies 
   or ecological adaptations.

4. Key biological processes including transcriptional regulation, translation, 
   signal transduction, and metabolic pathways are dynamically regulated across 
   the experimental timeline.

5. Species-independent components reveal conserved cellular machinery including
   translation, metabolic regulation, and stress response pathways that are 
   fundamental to coral biology regardless of species identity.

6. A substantial proportion of genes remain unannotated, indicating significant 
   unexplored biology in coral genomes that warrants further investigation.

PHYSIOLOGICAL CONTEXT
---------------------

Integration with physiological measurements reveals the following patterns:

• Chlorophyll content shows species-specific baseline differences, with dynamic
  changes across time points that may correlate with photosynthetic capacity
  and symbiont density.

• Symbiodinium density varies between species, reflecting differences in 
  symbiotic relationships and potentially heat tolerance strategies.

• Host biomass (AFDW) shows temporal dynamics that may be linked to the 
  metabolic and stress response gene expression patterns identified in the
  tensor decomposition.

• Calcification rates differ between species, with potential links to 
  components involved in biomineralization and ion transport gene expression.

• Protein content dynamics across time points may reflect the translation
  and protein synthesis pathways identified as major themes in the gene
  expression components.

These physiological measurements provide functional validation of the gene
expression patterns and help contextualize the molecular stress response
signatures across the three coral species.
