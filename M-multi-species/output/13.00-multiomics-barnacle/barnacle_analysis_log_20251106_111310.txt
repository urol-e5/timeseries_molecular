FMS-BASED RANK RECOMMENDATION
============================================================
Best Reconstruction FMS: Rank 75 (score: 0.9838)
Best Reconstruction Correlation: Rank 75 (score: 0.9676)
TLViz FMS: Not available (SciPy compatibility issue)

High-scoring ranks (top 20%): [55, 65, 75]
Threshold: 0.9637

FMS Interpretation:
• Reconstruction FMS is the PRIMARY metric for rank selection
  - Measures tensor reconstruction quality (0-1 scale)
  - Based on correlation between original and decomposed tensors
• Reconstruction correlation shows direct fit quality (-1 to 1)
  - Values > 0.9 indicate excellent reconstruction
  - Values > 0.8 indicate good reconstruction
• Higher scores = better factor recovery and model fit
• Consider ranks with consistently high Reconstruction FMS (top 20%)

Note: TLViz FMS unavailable due to scipy >= 1.14 incompatibility

FMS-BASED RANK RECOMMENDATION
============================================================
Best Reconstruction FMS: Rank 75 (score: 0.9838)
Best Reconstruction Correlation: Rank 75 (score: 0.9676)
Best TLViz FMS: Rank 10 (score: 1.0000)

High-scoring ranks (top 20%): [55, 65, 75]
Threshold: 0.9637

FMS Interpretation:
• Reconstruction FMS is the PRIMARY metric for rank selection
  - Measures tensor reconstruction quality (0-1 scale)
  - Based on correlation between original and decomposed tensors
• Reconstruction correlation shows direct fit quality (-1 to 1)
  - Values > 0.9 indicate excellent reconstruction
  - Values > 0.8 indicate good reconstruction
• Higher scores = better factor recovery and model fit
• Consider ranks with consistently high Reconstruction FMS (top 20%)
• TLViz FMS available and can be used for additional validation

FMS-BASED RANK RECOMMENDATION
============================================================
Best Reconstruction FMS: Rank 75 (score: 0.9838)
Best Reconstruction Correlation: Rank 75 (score: 0.9676)
Best TLViz FMS: Rank 10 (score: 1.0000)

High-scoring ranks (top 20%): [55, 65, 75]
Threshold: 0.9637

FMS Interpretation:
• Reconstruction FMS is the PRIMARY metric for rank selection
  - Measures tensor reconstruction quality (0-1 scale)
  - Based on correlation between original and decomposed tensors
• Reconstruction correlation shows direct fit quality (-1 to 1)
  - Values > 0.9 indicate excellent reconstruction
  - Values > 0.8 indicate good reconstruction
• Higher scores = better factor recovery and model fit
• Consider ranks with consistently high Reconstruction FMS (top 20%)
• TLViz FMS available and can be used for additional validation

============================================================
FACTOR MATCH SCORE (FMS) EVALUATION
============================================================
This analysis evaluates decomposition quality using the Factor Match Score
from the tensorly-viz (tlviz) library, which measures how well the
decomposed factors match the original tensor structure.
============================================================
Found 12 successful ranks to evaluate: [5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75]

============================================================
⚠️  SYNTHETIC VALIDATION ENABLED
============================================================
This will test factor recovery by:
  1. Creating synthetic tensor from each decomposition
  2. Adding noise to test robustness
  3. Re-decomposing to see if factors are recovered
Expected additional time: 18-24 minutes

75       0.4539          Poor         

Interpretation:
  • Synthetic FMS tests factor recovery from noisy data
  • Peak at rank 10 indicates best balance:
    - Sufficient complexity to capture patterns
    - Robust enough to avoid overfitting noise
  • Higher ranks show declining FMS (overfitting)
  • Lower ranks show lower FMS (underfitting)

Statistics:
  • Improvement to optimal: +0.2213
  • Average FMS after optimal: 0.5507
  • Decline from peak: -0.3564

    Gene selection summary:
      Sum method:      Favors genes active across many components
      Max method:      Favors genes strongly specific to one component
      Mean method:     Favors genes with consistent moderate activity
      Variance method: Favors genes with high component specificity

    Gene overlap between methods:
      Sum & Max:      47/50 genes in common
      Sum & Mean:     50/50 genes in common
      Max & Variance: 45/50 genes in common
