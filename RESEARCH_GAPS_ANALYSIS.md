## Key Findings from Repository

### Major Biological Insights

**1. Temperature-Associated Molecular Responses**
- Mean temperature significantly correlated with **10 gene modules** in *A. pulchra* WGCNA
- Timepoints 2 (March - warmest) and 3 (September - coolest) show similar module correlations
- **Hypothesis**: Similar molecular pathways respond to both heat and cold stress
- **Implication**: Corals may have general "thermal stress" response rather than direction-specific

**2. Temporal Dynamics of Stress Response**
- Timepoint effects are non-linear (can't treat as continuous variable)
- Need to encode as categorical (TP1, TP2, TP3, TP4) for proper analysis
- Environmental variables (temp, solar, rainfall) more informative than timepoint number
- **Gap**: Finer temporal resolution needed to understand dynamics

**3. Multi-Omics Integration Feasibility**
- MOFA2 successfully integrated 5 data types (genes, transcripts, lncRNA, miRNA, methylation)
- Latent factors explain variance across multiple omics layers
- Machine learning can predict gene expression from other omics (lncRNA, miRNA, WGBS)
- **Opportunity**: More sophisticated AI models could improve prediction

**4. miRNA Regulatory Networks**
- Extensive miRNA-mRNA co-expression modules identified
- Many miRNAs show time-dependent expression patterns
- Target prediction identifies potential regulatory relationships
- **Gap**: Validation of actual regulatory interactions is lacking

**5. Species Conservation and Divergence**
- 66% of *A. pulchra* proteins conserved across all three species
- 10,346 three-way orthologs = core ancestral gene set
- ~7,980 species-specific or two-way orthologs
- **Opportunity**: Comparative analysis of conserved vs. divergent stress responses

**6. Physiological Integration**
- Multi-omics correlates with physiological traits
- PC1 of physiology captures major variation
- Molecular-physiological relationships identifiable
- **Gap**: Causality unclear (correlation ≠ causation)
