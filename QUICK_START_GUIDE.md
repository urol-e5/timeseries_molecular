## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How were these documents created?
A: Based on comprehensive review of the repository, identification of gaps and opportunities, and strategic planning aligned with major funding opportunities.

### Q: Do we have to do ALL of this?
A: No! These documents present options. Pick 1-2 directions that align with your team's strengths and interests for your first proposal.

### Q: We don't have funding yet. Can we start?
A: Yes! Generate preliminary data, write proposals, publish from existing data. The documents show how to get funding.

### Q: What if we want to go in a different direction?
A: These are suggestions based on identified gaps. Adapt as needed for your team's vision and expertise.

### Q: How do I know which funding source to target?
A: See GRANT_WRITING_ACTION_PLAN.md for detailed comparison and recommendations. NSF BO is recommended for first submission.

### Q: This seems like a lot of work. Is it worth it?
A: Yes! The timeseries_molecular repository is a unique resource. These plans help maximize its impact and secure funding for continued research.

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Small:** First proposal can be moderate scope (NSF BO). Build to larger proposals.

2. **Build on Strengths:** Use existing repository data as preliminary results.

3. **Stay Focused:** Don't try to do all 5 research directions in one proposal.

4. **Get Feedback Early:** Share drafts with colleagues and collaborators.

5. **Be Realistic:** Conservative timelines and feasible methods increase success.

6. **Think Impact:** Both scientific (publications) and applied (conservation) outcomes.

7. **Budget Wisely:** Align budget with proposed work. Show cost-effectiveness.

8. **Engage Stakeholders:** Reef managers and conservation orgs as partners.
