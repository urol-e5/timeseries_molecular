# Sampling Dates for Timepoints TP1-TP4

## Overview

This document provides the specific sampling dates for the four timepoints (TP1-TP4) used throughout the timeseries molecular analyses in this repository.

## Sampling Dates

The four timepoints correspond to the following sampling periods in **2020**:

| Timepoint | Month & Year | Season |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **TP1** | **January 2020** | Austral Summer |
| **TP2** | **March 2020** | Austral Summer/Autumn |
| **TP3** | **September 2020** | Austral Winter/Spring |
| **TP4** | **November 2020** | Austral Spring |

## Location

Sampling occurred in **Mo'orea, French Polynesia** across three lagoon sites on the North shore.

## Species Sampled

Three coral species were sampled at each timepoint:
- *Acropora pulchra* (D-Apul)
- *Porites evermanni* (E-Peve) 
- *Pocillopora tuahiniensis* (F-Ptua)

## Additional Notes

- Each timepoint represents a distinct seasonal sampling period to capture temporal variation in coral physiology and molecular responses
- The sampling design allowed for tracking of the same tagged colonies across all four timepoints
- Environmental conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) varied significantly between timepoints, providing natural stress gradients
