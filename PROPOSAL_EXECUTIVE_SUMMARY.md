# Research Proposal Executive Summary
## Predictive Multi-Omics Framework for Coral Climate Resilience

**Building on timeseries_molecular repository**  
**January 2025**

---

## The Opportunity

Coral reefs face existential threats from climate change, with >75% at risk by 2050. Current management lacks molecular tools to predict which corals will survive and which restoration efforts will succeed. The timeseries_molecular repository provides a unique foundation of multi-omics data across three coral species and four timepoints. **We propose to extend this work into a predictive framework that transforms coral conservation.**

---

## Core Innovation

**From correlation to prediction:** Transform existing multi-omics correlations into validated biomarkers that predict coral survival under future climate scenarios **before** visible bleaching occurs.

**Key Advance:** Integration of AI-driven multi-omics analysis, single-cell genomics, functional validation, and field deployment into a comprehensive predictive framework.

- **Impact:** >80% prediction accuracy, field-deployable qPCR assays for managers

### 2. Causal Epigenetic Mechanisms ($1.5M, 5 years)
- **What:** Prove DNA methylation controls thermal tolerance using genome editing
- **How:** CRISPR-based epigenome editing, transgenerational tracking
- **Impact:** First functional validation in corals, guides assisted evolution strategies

### 3. Single-Cell Multi-Omics Atlas ($1.3M, 4 years)
- **What:** Cell-type-specific stress responses at unprecedented resolution
- **How:** scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics across 3 species
- **Impact:** Identify previously hidden cellular drivers of resilience

### 4. AI-Powered Climate Prediction ($1.0M, 5 years)
- **What:** Deep learning integration of all omics to predict responses to climate scenarios
- **How:** Graph neural networks, multi-task learning, IPCC scenario modeling
- **Impact:** Reef vulnerability maps for 2050, 2100 under RCP 4.5, 8.5

### 5. Comparative Phylogenomics ($1.0M, 4 years)
- **What:** Identify universal vs. species-specific resilience mechanisms
- **How:** Expand to 10 species spanning coral phylogeny
- **Impact:** Predict unstudied species, evolutionary constraints on adaptation

**Total Budget:** ~$6M over 5 years
