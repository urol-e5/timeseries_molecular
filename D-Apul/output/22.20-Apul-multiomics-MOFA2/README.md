`urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/D-Apul/output/22.20-Apul-multiomics-MOFA2/`

## Directory Overview
This directory contains output files generated by the R Markdown script `D-Apul/code/22.20-Apul-multiomics-MOFA2.Rmd`. These files are the result of multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA2) performed on the D-Apul dataset.

### File Origin
All files in this directory were created by running the MOFA2 workflow in the above R Markdown script. The script integrates multiple omics datasets and produces trained MOFA2 models and their factors in both HDF5 and RDS formats.

NOTE: Due to the large file sizes of the output files, they are not uploaded to GitHub.

They are available here: https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/gitrepos/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/D-Apul/output/22.20-Apul-multiomics-MOFA2/

## Usage
These files can be loaded in R or Python for further analysis, visualization, or integration with other omics data. Refer to the original R Markdown script for details on how the models were generated and example code for downstream usage.
