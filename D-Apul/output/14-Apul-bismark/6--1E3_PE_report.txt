Bismark report for: /home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/sam/gitrepos/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/D-Apul/output/01.20-D-Apul-WGBS-trimming-fastp-FastQC-MultiQC/6--1E3_R1_001.fastp-trim.fq.gz and /home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/sam/gitrepos/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/D-Apul/output/01.20-D-Apul-WGBS-trimming-fastp-FastQC-MultiQC/6--1E3_R2_001.fastp-trim.fq.gz (version: v0.24.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/sam/gitrepos/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/D-Apul/data/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-1.0 -p 8 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	48546692
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	31028265
Mapping efficiency:	63.9% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	7881509
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	9636918
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	37

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	15530989	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	15497239	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
