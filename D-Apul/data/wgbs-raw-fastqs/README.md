### Directory for whole genome bisulfite sequencing FastQ data.

Due to large file sizes of FastQs, those files can be found here:

[https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/gitrepos/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/D-Apul/data/wgbs-raw-fastqs/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/gitrepos/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/D-Apul/data/wgbs-raw-fastqs/)

#### IMPORTANT! Files were renamed in this Rmd file ([00.20-D-Apul-WGBS-reads-FastQC-MultiQC.Rmd](../../code/00.20-D-Apul-WGBS-reads-FastQC-MultiQC.md)) to reflect colony ID and timepoint, in order to maintain consistency across projects and improve downstream parsing/analysis.

The MD5 files in this directory reflect the original filenaming!
