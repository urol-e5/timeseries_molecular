## Tips for Strong Proposals

### Writing Style

**Do:**
âœ“ Use active voice and clear, direct language  
âœ“ Tell a compelling story with logical flow  
âœ“ Use subheadings to guide readers  
âœ“ Include high-quality, informative figures  
âœ“ Be specific about methods and timelines  
âœ“ Show enthusiasm and significance  

**Don't:**
âœ— Use jargon unnecessarily  
âœ— Make unsupported claims  
âœ— Ignore page limits or formatting  
âœ— Forget to define acronyms  
âœ— Assume reviewers know your system  
âœ— Be overly ambitious (seems infeasible)  

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting too late** - Begin 6+ months before deadline
2. **Not following instructions** - Read solicitation carefully
3. **Poor writing** - Get help from grant writing experts
4. **Weak preliminary data** - Generate convincing pilot data
5. **Unrealistic timeline** - Build in buffer time
6. **Vague methods** - Be specific enough to replicate
7. **Ignoring broader impacts** - Give these serious attention
8. **Missing collaborator letters** - Request these early
9. **Budget doesn't match plan** - Align carefully
10. **No risk mitigation** - Address potential problems

---

### Figures and Visuals

**Effective Proposal Figures:**
- High resolution and professional appearance
- Clear labels and legends
