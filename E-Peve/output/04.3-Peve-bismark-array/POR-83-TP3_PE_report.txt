Bismark report for: ../../data/03-Peve-bismark/POR-83-TP3_R1_001.fastp-trim.fq.gz and ../../data/03-Peve-bismark/POR-83-TP3_R2_001.fastp-trim.fq.gz (version: v0.24.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mmfs1/gscratch/srlab/sr320/github/timeseries_molecular/E-Peve/data/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 12 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	29875318
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	19369386
Mapping efficiency:	64.8% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	8051274
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	2454658
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	3500

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	9699836	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	9666050	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
