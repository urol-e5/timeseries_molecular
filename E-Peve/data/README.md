Part of the output from [`00-genome-GFF-formatting.Rmd`](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/blob/91a747876bdca5c62f15b64ea87f56f2b8fd093b/E-Peve/code/00.00-genome-GFF-formatting.Rmd).

- [`Porites_evermanni_v1.annot.gff`](./Porites_evermanni_v1.annot.gff): Genomic GFF downloaded from [https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/corals/data/Porites_evermanni_v1.annot.gff](https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/corals/data/Porites_evermanni_v1.annot.gff).
  NOTE: This GFF is malformed and does not fit the GFF standard. Additionally, the only features present are `mRNA`, `CDS`, and `UTR`. It lacks `gene` features. 

  A validated version, with added `gene` features was generated: [`Porites_evermanni_validated.gff`](./Porites_evermanni_validated.gff).
